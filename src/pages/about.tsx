                    <p>Hello! Welcome to my site, my name is Ed.</p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a {getMyAge()} year old software developer, currently living in Oxford, UK with my lovely {marriageStatus()} Rosie.
                        I grew up in Chester, and have previously lived in Guildford and also Durham, where I studied.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Don't consider this website a 'portfolio' as such. It's merely a place on the Internet I can call my own,
                        and a hub for all the random stuff I like to make. Making things is my passion (not only with code, I also
                        love to paint), so this is my way of showing off to the world what I love to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thank you so much for reading, and please enjoy your look around!
                    </p>
